# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created basics for discord bot in go.

**Thoughts**: They changed the discordgo API a bit, and I had to re-figure that out...

### Day 2: 22 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic implementation for maintenance and the fashion report

**Thoughts**: Go makes iterating over maps run in a non-predictable order. Remembered I was keeping an array of this data, so I could just use the array to get the order the user defined.

### Day 3: 23 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added some docker build bits and added some code to show better output for ongoing maintenance.

**Thoughts**: So many edge cases! Plus, it looks like poop, I wanna make the output prettier.

### Day 4: 24 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made the embeds look a bit fancier, I need to create some mock data for testing what they look like though...

**Thoughts**: I really wish the Reddit API I am using for go had actual documentation, it just links to Reddit's API, which is less than helpful.
Maybe I'm on the wrong page, but Reddit's API doesn't make figuring out what the returned data looks like very easy...

### Day 5: 25 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Might not have a full hour today, but converted it to use the "current" maintenance endpoint.

**Thoughts**: I need to create some kind of automated build thing for this. I can live without automated deploy for now, but builds would be handy.

### Day 6: 26 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started a react project to make sure I can do a thing on Tuesday.

**Thoughts**: Documentation for starting a typescript project with react is a bit lacking, but I think I've got it sorted. Also, can I help VSCode's import import Material Icon's easier?
Missed Thursday, that's probably going to kinda be a thing, as I have a Destiny 2 raid those nights, and that doesn't leave much time for work+dinner+code. I'll accept it as something I have failed at.

**Link to work**: None for today, there's nothing to commit.

### Day 7 28 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Put together some golang to prep for an interview Tuesday

**Thoughts**: Interacting with SQL without an ORM is simulatneously better, because I feel like I write far less boilerplate, but it's also quite a lot more wrangling to bind parameters and such.

**Link to work**: No link for this

### Day 8 29 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Put together the React and Redux UI stuff to prep for the Tuesday interview

**Thoughts**: I'm terrified I've overprepared and they'll be upset, but I'm also terrified of potentially underpreparing. Wee

**Link to work**: No link for today either
