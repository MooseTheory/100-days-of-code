# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created basics for discord bot in go.

**Thoughts**: They changed the discordgo API a bit, and I had to re-figure that out...

### Day 2: 22 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic implementation for maintenance and the fashion report

**Thoughts**: Go makes iterating over maps run in a non-predictable order. Remembered I was keeping an array of this data, so I could just use the array to get the order the user defined.
