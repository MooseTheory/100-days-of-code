# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created basics for discord bot in go.

**Thoughts**: They changed the discordgo API a bit, and I had to re-figure that out...

### Day 2: 22 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic implementation for maintenance and the fashion report

**Thoughts**: Go makes iterating over maps run in a non-predictable order. Remembered I was keeping an array of this data, so I could just use the array to get the order the user defined.

### Day 3: 23 August 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added some docker build bits and added some code to show better output for ongoing maintenance.

**Thoughts**: So many edge cases! Plus, it looks like poop, I wanna make the output prettier.
